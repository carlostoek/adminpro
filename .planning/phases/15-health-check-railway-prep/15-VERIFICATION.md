# Phase 15: Health Check & Railway Preparation Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Health monitoring endpoint and Railway deployment configuration
**Verified:** 2026-01-29T09:41:11Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Score:** 6/6 must-haves verified
**Re-verification:** Yes - after graceful shutdown fix (15-05)

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Endpoint HTTP /health retorna 200 OK cuando bot y base de datos están funcionando | ✓ VERIFIED | `bot/health/endpoints.py:89-94` returns HTTP 200 for healthy/degraded status. Health check returns JSON with status, timestamp, and components. |
| 2 | Health check retorna 503 Service Unavailable cuando hay errores en DB | ✓ VERIFIED | `bot/health/endpoints.py:89-90` returns HTTP 503 when `summary["status"] == "unhealthy"`. Database check in `check.py:98-104` catches exceptions and returns UNHEALTHY. |
| 3 | Bot y API de salud corren concurrentemente (FastAPI en puerto separado) | ✓ VERIFIED | `main.py:172-183` starts health server with `await start_health_server()`. `runner.py:96` uses `asyncio.create_task()` for concurrent execution. Health API runs on port 8000 (configurable via HEALTH_PORT). |
| 4 | Railway.toml configurado con comando de inicio y health check path | ✓ VERIFIED | `Railway.toml:11-15` has `healthcheckPath = "/health"`, `healthcheckPort = 8000`, `healthcheckTimeout = 300`, `healthcheckInterval = 30`. Points to correct Dockerfile. |
| 5 | Dockerfile creado para despliegue en Railway con variables de entorno validadas | ✓ VERIFIED | `Dockerfile:1-55` multi-stage build with non-root user (botuser), exposes port 8000, includes Docker HEALTHCHECK. `main.py:78,143` calls `Config.validate()` on startup which validates required environment variables. |
| 6 | Bot responde a Ctrl+C y se detiene limpiamente sin procesos huérfanos | ✓ VERIFIED | `main.py:284` sets `AiohttpSession(timeout=10)` (was 120). `main.py:359` sets polling `timeout=10` (was 30). Combined timeout: 10s max for Ctrl+C response. Enhanced shutdown logging in `main.py:329,334-341,364-365,370-376`. UAT confirmed fix works. |

**Score:** 6/6 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `bot/health/check.py` | Health check functions | ✓ VERIFIED | 157 lines, implements `check_bot_health()`, `check_database_health()`, `HealthStatus` enum, `get_health_summary()`. No stub patterns. |
| `bot/health/endpoints.py` | FastAPI with /health endpoint | ✓ VERIFIED | 102 lines, implements `/health` and `/` endpoints. Returns 200 for healthy/degraded, 503 for unhealthy. No stub patterns. |
| `bot/health/runner.py` | Concurrent server runner | ✓ VERIFIED | 100 lines, implements `run_health_api()` and `start_health_server()`. Uses `asyncio.create_task()` for concurrent execution. |
| `bot/health/__init__.py` | Module exports | ✓ VERIFIED | 24 lines, exports `HealthStatus`, `check_bot_health`, `check_database_health`, `get_health_summary`, `create_health_app`. |
| `requirements.txt` | FastAPI and uvicorn dependencies | ✓ VERIFIED | Contains `fastapi==0.109.0`, `uvicorn==0.27.0`. |
| `Railway.toml` | Railway configuration | ✓ VERIFIED | 20 lines, configured with health check path `/health`, port 8000, timeout 300s, restart policy ON_FAILURE. |
| `Dockerfile` | Container deployment | ✓ VERIFIED | 55 lines, multi-stage build, non-root user (botuser), exposes port 8000, includes Docker HEALTHCHECK, sets proper environment variables. |
| `.dockerignore` | Exclude dev artifacts | ✓ VERIFIED | 65 lines, excludes `__pycache__`, `.env`, `bot.db`, `.git`, `.planning/`, test files, logs, etc. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|---|---|--------|---------|
| `endpoints.py` | `check.py` | `import get_health_summary` | ✓ WIRED | `endpoints.py:13` imports `get_health_summary`, used in `endpoints.py:86`. |
| `endpoints.py` | `config.py` | `Config.BOT_TOKEN, Config.DATABASE_URL` | ✓ WIRED | `check.py:12,52` uses `Config.BOT_TOKEN` and `Config.DATABASE_URL`. |
| `check.py` | `database/engine.py` | `get_engine()` | ✓ WIRED | `check.py:14,84` imports and uses `get_engine()` for DB connectivity check. |
| `main.py` | `health/runner.py` | `start_health_server()` | ✓ WIRED | `main.py:21,118,179` imports and calls `start_health_server()`. |
| `runner.py` | `endpoints.py` | `create_health_app()` | ✓ WIRED | `runner.py:15,41` imports and uses `create_health_app()`. |
| `main.py` | `config.py` | `Config.validate()` | ✓ WIRED | `main.py:78,143` calls `Config.validate()` on startup to validate required environment variables. |
| `main.py` | `aiogram` | `AiohttpSession(timeout=10)` | ✓ WIRED | `main.py:284` creates session with 10s timeout for responsive shutdown. |
| `Dockerfile` | `main.py` | `CMD ["python", "main.py"]` | ✓ WIRED | `Dockerfile:55` runs main application on container start. |
| `Railway.toml` | `Dockerfile` | `dockerfile = "Dockerfile"` | ✓ WIRED | `Railway.toml:6` specifies Dockerfile to use. |
| `main.py` | `health API` | `dispatcher.workflow_data['health_task']` | ✓ WIRED | `main.py:187,241` stores and retrieves health task for graceful shutdown. |

### Requirements Coverage

Based on ROADMAP.md requirements for Phase 15:

**HEALTH-01 through HEALTH-05:** ✅ SATISFIED
- Health endpoint returns 200/503 based on system health
- Checks bot token validity and database connectivity
- Runs concurrently with bot on separate port
- Graceful shutdown stops both services cleanly

**RAIL-01 through RAIL-05:** ✅ SATISFIED
- Railway.toml configured with health check path and port
- Dockerfile uses multi-stage build with non-root user
- Environment variables validated on startup
- .dockerignore excludes development artifacts
- Health check path matches Railway configuration

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| None | - | - | - | No anti-patterns detected in health or deployment modules |

**Anti-pattern scan results:**
- ✅ No TODO/FIXME comments in health modules
- ✅ No placeholder content
- ✅ No empty return statements
- ✅ All functions have substantive implementations
- ✅ All imports are used
- ✅ No console.log only implementations

### Human Verification Required

None. All automated checks passed with clear evidence in code.

**Previous UAT issues resolved:**
- ✅ Test 4 (Graceful Shutdown) previously failed with 150-second timeout
- ✅ Fix committed in dc0dbfd: Reduced timeouts from 150s to 10s
- ✅ UAT summary confirms: "Ctrl+C → Bot stops in 1-2 seconds", "No orphaned processes", "Immediate restart works"

### Gaps Summary

**No gaps found.** Phase 15 successfully implemented all required features:

1. ✅ FastAPI health check endpoint with proper HTTP status codes (200/503)
2. ✅ Bot and database health checks with comprehensive error handling
3. ✅ Concurrent execution of bot and health API on separate ports
4. ✅ Railway.toml configuration for deployment monitoring
5. ✅ Dockerfile optimized for Railway with multi-stage build and non-root user
6. ✅ Environment variable validation on startup via `Config.validate()`
7. ✅ Graceful shutdown with 10-second timeout (down from 150s)
8. ✅ No orphaned processes after shutdown
9. ✅ Health API and bot both stop cleanly on Ctrl+C
10. ✅ .dockerignore excludes development artifacts

**Re-verification Notes:**
- Previous verification (2026-01-29T00:58:00Z) found all must-haves verified
- Gap closure plan (15-05) addressed graceful shutdown issue
- Fix reduced HTTP timeouts from 150s to 10s
- UAT confirmed fix works as expected
- No regressions detected

The health check system is fully functional and ready for Railway deployment.
